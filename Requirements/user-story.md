Problem Statement
As a Neighborhood Treasurer (RT Treasurer), I need a system that can help simplify my financial responsibilities and make it easier to monitor income and expense reports of the neighborhood funds.

System Requirements
1. The system must be able to generate financial reports based on a selected period (e.g., monthly or yearly).
2. The system must have a simple and user-friendly UI for recording income and expense transactions.
